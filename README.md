# HARKD

A laboratory measurement automation tool, which consists on two programs;

	•  HARKDC – A console based program that serves as «backend». It communicates
		with the laboratory instrumentation and contains the proceedings for carrying
		on the measurements.
		
	•  HARKDW – A graphical program to perform measurements. It acts as a «frontend»
		and uses HARKDC in the background. 

The source code is distributed to the customer. It uses a modular approach so adding 
support for new tests and devices is relatively easy. The source code is available
here [harkdc](https://github.com/harkaitz/harkdc) and [harkdw](https://github.com/harkaitz/harkdw).
